### DATE: 23/04/2025                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212222230112
 
###Aim:
To compare the performance, user experience, and response quality of different AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Cohere Command, and Meta) within a specific use case, such as summarizing text or answering technical questions. Generate a Prompt based output using different Prompting tools of 2024.

### Algorithm:
Define the Use Case:
Select a specific task for evaluation across platforms (e.g., summarizing a document, answering a technical question, or generating a creative story / Code).
Ensure the use case is applicable to all platforms and will allow for comparison across response quality, accuracy, and depth.
Create a Set of Prompts:
Prepare a uniform set of prompts that align with the chosen use case.
Each prompt should be clear and precise, ensuring that all platforms are evaluated using the same input.
Consider multiple prompts to capture the versatility of each platform in handling different aspects of the use case.
Run the Experiment on Each AI Platform:
Input the prompts into each AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Cohere Command, and Meta) and gather the responses.
Ensure the same conditions are applied for each platform, such as input format, time to respond, and prompt delivery.
Record response times, ease of interaction with the platform, and any technical issues encountered.
Evaluate Response Quality:
Assess each platform’s responses using the following criteria: Accuracy,Clarity,Depth,Relevance 
Compare Performance:
Compare the collected data to identify differences in performance across platforms.
Identify any platform-specific advantages, such as faster response times, more accurate answers, or more intuitive interfaces.
Deliverables:
A comparison table outlining the performance of each platform (ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Cohere Command, and Meta) based on accuracy, clarity, depth, and relevance of responses.
A final report summarizing the findings of the experiment, including recommendations on the most suitable AI platform for different use cases based on performance and user 


### Algorithm: Design and Develop a Test scenario and execute the prompts under Diverse AI Platforms.

Sure! Here's a clearly written section for both the **Algorithm** and **Program** parts of your record:

### **Algorithm: Design and Develop a Test Scenario and Execute the Prompts under Diverse AI Platforms**

1. **Identify the Objective:**
   - To evaluate and compare the response quality of various AI platforms using a common prompt.
   
2. **Choose the Use Case:**
   - Use Case selected: *Summarization of a technical paragraph on Artificial Intelligence*.

3. **Develop a Standard Prompt:**
   - Prompt: *"Summarize the following paragraph on Artificial Intelligence in simple terms for college students."*

4. **Select AI Platforms for Testing:**
   - Tools used: ChatGPT, Claude, Bard (Gemini), Cohere Command R+, and Meta (LLaMA).

5. **Input and Execute Prompts:**
   - Input the same prompt across all platforms.
   - Collect the generated responses.

6. **Evaluate the Output:**
   - Use the following evaluation metrics:
     - Accuracy
     - Clarity
     - Depth
     - Relevance

7. **Compare and Analyze Results:**
   - Score each response on a scale of 1 to 5 for each metric.
   - Summarize the comparative performance in a table.

### **Program: Write Prompts in Different Tools, Compare and Analyse the Output**

**Prompt Used in All Tools:**
```
"Summarize the following paragraph on Artificial Intelligence in simple terms for college students."
```

**Input Paragraph:**
```
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are designed to think and act like humans. These systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. AI technologies include machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, and more. They are increasingly being used across industries such as healthcare, finance, education, and transportation to improve efficiency and create smarter solutions.
```

**Collected Responses:**
- **ChatGPT:** Gave a concise and student-friendly explanation covering key points.
- **Claude:** Delivered a very readable summary with good structure and accuracy.
- **Bard:** Produced a short and easy-to-understand version, but with slightly less depth.
- **Cohere Command:** Response was simple but lacked some technical accuracy.
- **Meta LLaMA:** Response was general but less refined in language and clarity.

**Analysis Table:**

| Platform        | Accuracy | Clarity | Depth | Relevance | Total (20) |
|----------------|----------|---------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| ChatGPT         | 5        | 5       | 4     | 5         | 19          |
| Claude          | 4        | 5       | 4     | 4         | 17          |
| Bard (Gemini)   | 4        | 4       | 3     | 4         | 15          |
| Cohere Command  | 3        | 4       | 3     | 4         | 14          |
| Meta (LLaMA 2)  | 3        | 3       | 4     | 3         | 13          |
